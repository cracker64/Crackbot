To use the Lua sandbox included in this plugin, you must either compile the binaries using the Makefile or the SConsscript 
or download them from http://vps3.wolfy1339.tk/~wolfy1339/wolfybot-lua-sandbox-binaries.zip
Extract the Zip file, and copy the two executables inside the sandbox directory which lies within the plugins directory of wherein WolfyBot resides.
